# refinery_time_calculator
Script to estimate time for ore refinement on Space Engineers

My current goal is to write a script that can;
- trigger is a buggon push
- query all containers for an ore count
- Calcuate times for refinment based on ore types/count.
- display estimate on an lcd & the info panel on terminal.

I'm writing this function in python, since that's the language I'm most familiar with.

I'm also planning on using MMaster's LCD2 script to display the data, which could also be a source for an ore count.
